# Heka (Lung Cancer Detection Application)
## Description 
This app is purposed to detect Lung Cancer using biomarkers including age, gender, epigenetic factors and genetic factors. The procedure depends on forming a correlation between the mentioned variables and the disease recurrence percentage. Epigenetic factors concern lifestyle such being in a polluted environment, being exposed to enormous amounts of smoke and exposure to hazardous materials. Genetic factors include mutations that lead to tumors raising lung cancer recurrence. The aim of this app is to notify patients in an early stage that would preserve medication as a savior option. It is highly recommended to check one's health if he got a 50-percent recurrence or higher. It is also worth mentioning that biomarkers do not imply a hundred-percent accuracy which states that a low percentage does not guarantee full recovery and a high one does imply a certain infection.
